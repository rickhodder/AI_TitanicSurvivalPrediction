# AI_TitanicSurvivalPrediction
A first project for dipping my toes into Machine Learning in python. This will be a small, classic machine learning project where you predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their features. 

The plan is do gain:
- hands‑on ML experience
- Python practice
- data cleaning + feature engineering skills
- a complete end‑to‑end ML workflow
